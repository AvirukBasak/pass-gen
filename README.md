# Pass Gen

Remembering passwords is hard. This is a simple password generator that can be used to generate passwords for you.

Unlike other password generators, this one **DOES NOT** generate random passwords.

Instead, you need to enter a `seed` which is a word or phrase, and you need to enter an `iter` which is a **PIN** number that you can remember.

The password is generated by hashing the `seed` and `iter` together.

You'll need to remember the `seed` and `iter` to generate the same password again.

Slight changes to the `seed` or `iter` will result in a completely different password as the generator uses `SHA256`.

## Usage Example
- Let the `seed` be the domain name of the website.
- Let the `iter` be a unique **PIN** number that only you know and use across various websites.

This way, you can generate a unique password for each website you visit, and you only need to remember the **PIN** to generate the password again.

Additionally, if you're visiting a phishing website, the password generated will be different from the one you use on the original website (coz of differences in the domain name). As a result you will be saved from giving away your real password.
